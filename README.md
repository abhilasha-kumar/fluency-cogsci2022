# Mouse-mole-vole: The inconspicuous benefit of phonology during retrieval from semantic memory

This repository contains the data and analysis scripts for the methods and analyses reported in the paper titled "Mouse-mole-vole: The inconspicuous benefit of phonology during retrieval from semantic memory" published in the Proceedings of the 44th Annual Meeting of the Cognitive Science Society.

Our analyses were conducted in two steps:

1. We precomputed some response measures (such as semantic similarity, phonological similarity, frequency) and then fit optimal foraging models on these response measures. The details of these analyses are in the Jupyter notebook.

2. Next, we conducted some analyses of the behavioral data as well as compared the foraging models. These analyses can be found in the Rmd notebook.

To reproduce our analyses, first run the Jupyter notebook to obtain the similarity metrics and foraging model fits, and then head over to the Rmd notebook for the analysis scripts.
